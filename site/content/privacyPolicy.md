  Introduction 

  MiTSO are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and to comply
  with our obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR)
  (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003. The
  purpose of this policy is to set out the basis on which any personal data that
  MiTSO collects from you, or that you provide to MiTSO, will be processed by
  our website. By visiting our website, users are accepting and consenting to
  the terms and conditions as described in this policy.


  For the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) (Regulation (EU)
  2016/679) and the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003, as amended (the “DPA”),
  the data controller of personal data processed and collected using this
  website is MiTSO of 41 Faugiletra Road, Jonesborough, Newry, Co.Down, BT35
  8JE.


  This website uses Google Analytics to help analyse how visitors use this site.
  Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are small text files placed on your
  computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour
  information in an anonymous form. This information is anonymous, as no
  personally identifiable information is collected about you unless you
  explicitly submit such information through our website.


  The anonymous information generated by Google Analytics cookies about your use
  of this website is transmitted to Google – not MiTSO. This information is
  processed to compile statistical reports on website activity for this website
  only. MiTSO use these reports to evaluate aggregate visitor usage so that we
  can optimise the content, and its marketing, to better meet your needs.

  You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our website or
  requesting communications about a service within our business or an employment
  opportunity, or by corresponding with us by phone or email regarding
  information on our website. This includes information you provide the website
  when searching for information, interacting with any interactive features or
  in using other social media functions on our website. Information you give us
  may include, but not limited to your name, address, email address, phone
  number(s) website address. 


  On each of your visits to our website, we may automatically collect
  information about website traffic, performance and visitor demographics. This
  information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses and is aggregated and
  anonymised. This information is used for administering our website and for
  testing purposes. 


  We use named third-party service providers to process and store user data.

  lists and send promotional emails to our subscribers.  


  If you enter our competitions on social media, we may collect information
  relating to your social media account including your name, address, email
  address, date of birth, information from your public profile including friends
  and connections, log in details and other information based on your
  interaction with us. You can manage the data which is shared by these social
  media providers with us by amending your privacy settings for your social
  media account. 


  Security of personal data 

  MiTSO cannot warranty the security of any information that you share with us
  through the internet, as no data transferred through the internet can be
  guaranteed as being 100% secure. Any such transmission is completed at your
  own risk. MiTSO will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal data
  and will use all necessary security procedures and security features to try to
  prevent unauthorised access.

  including any requests for changes to, or removal of the information held. At
  any time, you can make a written request to have access to the personal data
  that we hold about you and may be subject to an administration charge (if
  applicable). All requests for personal data should be sent to
