EStars featuring Fortnite, toured some of the biggest sports stadiums in the UK and Ireland from January to March 2019. Thousands of avid Fortnite fans and gaming enthusiasts took part in the hope of winning Â£25,000.

# Our role

Our role was to generate hype around the tournament, sell tickets and further establish EStars as a global brand.

We conducted market research initially to understand the game and its players and developed a digital and PR campaign centred around raising brand awareness and converting to ticket sales.

For EStars, it was important to continually deliver engaging and attractive content. We provided graphic design and videography services, managing all social channels for the duration of the tournament.

## Results: 

* Over 6,000 tickets sold
* 97% increase in website traffic
* 30% increase in social following across all channels
* 30,000 video views on YouTube
* Successful collaboration with Tesla and interest from other major global brands
* Plans to take the tournament to Dubai and further afield
