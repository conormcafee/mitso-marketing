  I was lucky enough to be given Mitso’s contact information when our company
  decided to undertake a complete rebranding exercise. From day 1 meeting Maeve
  I knew we had made the right choice. Not only is she fantastic at her job but
  she also naturally adapts to suit her environment and her audience. 

  She is extremely efficient, focused and patient! She listens to what you need
  whilst also giving you direction and ideas. She delivered on everything we
  needed and more and we could not have achieved what we did without her. We
  continue to use her company’s services.

  I would highly recommend her and her team, you will not be disappointed.

Having met the senior team at Obelisk, it became clear that the company had huge ambitions and wanted to expand globally.

We began (as we always do) by establishing a solid client relationship and understanding Obelisk’ customer base.

We worked hard with the senior team, organising a number of workshops in order to find the correct balance between information the company wanted to promote vs. Information that was important to the client.
