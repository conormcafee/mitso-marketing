Having met the senior team at Obelisk, it became clear that the company had huge ambitions and wanted to expand globally.

We began (as we always do) by establishing a solid client relationship and understanding Obeliskâ€™ customer base.

We worked hard with the senior team, organising a number of workshops in order to find the correct balance between information the company wanted to promote vs. Information that was important to the client.
