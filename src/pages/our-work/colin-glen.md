testimonial: >-
  We've been working with MiTSO since September 2019 and are delighted with the
  work they've done. While the team were initially brought on to manage our
  social channels we knew there was no one better to develop our new website.
  The new website is beyond our expectations and we can't believe how the new
  booking system has dramatically decreased our workload. We can't wait to
  launch our exciting new attractions and will be confident in doing so with the
  help of the MiTSO team.

Since its inception, Colin Glen Trust has been dedicated to restoring and maintaining Colin Glen Forest Park and creating unique natural spaces and attractions. This includes a Gruffalo trail, SKYTrek ropes course, Indoor 3G dome and Ireland's first Toptracer Driving Range. The organisation is currently preparing to launch Ireland's first alpine coaster as well as Ireland's longest zipline.

## **Social media management, Social advertising, Videography, Photography, Website development, Branded Assets and PR**

MiTSO were first recruited to create and manage organic and paid social content for Colin Glen. In order to achieve greater engagement with their online audiences, MiTSO arranged [videography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fopQIZQ_AZc) to capture the organisation's attractions and promote the range of activities available. This involved story boarding, developing messaging and including appropriate actors reflecting key target audiences.

MiTSO managed social campaigns across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to increase awareness of the organisation, attractions, events and special offers which resulted in widespread engagement and increased website traffic. Alongside the campaign, influencers including [Cathy Martin](https://www.instagram.com/cathymartin10/) were recruited to promote the facilities and increase follower growth across social channels. 

Following the success of the social advertising campaigns, MiTSO were appointed to design and develop a [new website](colinglen.org) complete with a bespoke booking system. Market research was conducted prior to development to gain a greater understanding of the essential features and functionalities of Colin Glen's range of users which were incorporated in the design phase.

A conversion-oriented design approach was taken in order to streamline the user journey, enhance user experience and maximise sales. The website encompasses the ethos of Colin Glen and helps to communicate the amazing work of this community resource.
