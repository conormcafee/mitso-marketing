We first began working with Coral Coast at the end of 2019. The company was confident in their brand identity and their product range, but felt that this was not reflected in their online sales. 

# Website redevelopment and digital advertising

After some initial research we found that while the store had a strong social following, this wasn’t generating sufficient website traffic and more importantly, online sales. MiTSO were recruited to evaluate and develop Coral Coast’s current [ecommerce site](coralcoastclothing.com) and increase traffic by planning and managing a PPC and social advertising campaign. 

Website development was focused on improving website design and customer experience by incorporating fonts and colours in line with brand guidelines. MiTSO improved layout visibility and delivered a conversion oriented website.

Once the website redevelopment was complete, MiTSO launched the brand’s Christmas Campaign targeted at male and female luxury shoppers. The campaign ran across Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the Google Display Network for just over two weeks and help increase online traffic by 486%. 

Since then, we have worked on a number of sales campaigns for the brand including seasonal campaigns such as Valentine’s Day and their current ‘Better Days’ campaign which offers Bermudians staying at home 20% off to reduce the spread of Covid-19.
