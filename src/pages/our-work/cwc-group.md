[CWC Group](www.cwcgroup.org) is a healthcare leader providing nursing, residential and disability care in picturesque locations throughout Northern Ireland.

# **Branding**

With a clear brief, MiTSO was challenged to refresh the care home group identity and to create and implement a new brand to be used across all marketing collateral. 

CWC Group’s mission of delivering safe and effective care through the promotion of a greater quality of life was a powerful message that needed to be at the forefront of their new brand. Visually it was important to convey the person-centred care approach in a modern way using symbolism in the contemporary logo. 

The newly developed brand is at the heart of the website design, from the colour scheme to the subtle inclusion of the icon throughout. 

We also designed a set of brand guidelines for CWC Group to distribute throughout the group to ensure a consistent use of logos, typography and colours in all digital communications. MiTSO also designed a range of brand stationery for employees including bespoke letterheads for each home and an email signature. 

# **Website Development**

To keep in line with CWC Group’s new branding, we wanted to deliver a website with a modern feel with that reflects their ethos. Our aim was to tell the story of CWC Group, allowing the user to fully understand the range of high-quality facilities they have, leading to improved brand loyalty. 

Our modern, fully responsive user interface was designed with families and patients in mind. Our emphasis on providing straight-forward navigation ensured users could access the range of information on different services and homes CWC Group offer across Northern Ireland. 

We highly recommend capturing impactful imagery to assist with the launch of new digital channels. Particularly, as CWC Group were focused on person-centred care, it was important to include images focused on interactions and settings that promote a safe and homely environment. 

It was our primary goal to develop an identity that reflected CWC Group’s values and was carried across the brand’s touchpoints and utilised throughout all brand communications across various printed and digital applications.
