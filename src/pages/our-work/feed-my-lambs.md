testimonial: >-
  It was a real pleasure to work with MiTSO Marketing to develop a new website
  for Feed My Lambs Ministry in Haiti. Everyone I worked with was professional,
  helpful and patient. They helped me navigate through information, photos and
  suggestions - from a distance and during Covid 19 and then pulled it all
  together to create what is now a user friendly and informative website that I
  hope will inspire people to donate to a very worthwhile organisation that is
  helping children in that very poor country.

Feed My Lambs is a Bermudian non-profit organisation which provides shelter, food and education to the children of Haiti. 

The charity approached us to design and develop a new [fully responsive website](https://www.feedmylambsministry.org) and to remove some of the barriers for people donating or supporting the charity.

Our focus was on delivering a site which would primarily help to inform, to bring to light the great work Feed My Lambs does and to encourage support for the organisation.

Key elements of the project included improved brand identity, repurposed visuals and copy and a streamlined donation process, making it much easier for people to make donations and express interest in volunteering.

Overall, this has been one of our most rewarding projects to date and we count ourselves lucky to be supporting such an amazing charity in its mission to protect children.
