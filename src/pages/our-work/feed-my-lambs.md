testimonial: >-
  It was a real pleasure to work with MiTSO Marketing to develop a new website
  for Feed My Lambs Ministry in Haiti. Everyone I worked with was professional,
  helpful and patient. They helped me navigate through information, photos and
  suggestions - from a distance and during Covid 19 and then pulled it all
  together to create what is now a user friendly and informative website that I
  hope will inspire people to donate to a very worthwhile organisation that is
  helping children in that very poor country.

Feed My Lambs approached us to design and develop a new fully responsive website for the charity. Intiially, we worked with the charity to establish its requirements and to uncover some of the barriers for people donating or supporting the charity.

Our focus was on providing information to help inform people about the work Feed My Lambs is involved in and to tell the story of the children of Haiti. 

We helped to develop key messages and to gather and organise information and visual content which had historically been stored in various locations. In addition, we helped to improve the brand identity, introducing vibrant colours and fonts.

Copywriting was a key element, to reflect the fantastic work Feed My Lambs and to bring to light the reality of the dire conditions children in Haiti live in and tackle, on a daily basis.

Most importantly, the website was designed to make it easy for people to make donations, sponsor children and to express interest in volunteering.
