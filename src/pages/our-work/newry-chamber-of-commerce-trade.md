  The MiTSO team were truly professional in the delivery of a high profile
  campaign for Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade. The challenge was to deliver
  a 4 week campaign in support of the Chamberâ€™s Brexit advice campaign, across
  newspapers and social media. 


  In an ever changing political environment, they responded quickly and
  creatively to changes in the campaign requirements. Their strong understanding
  of social media allowed them to adapt and change the emphasis of the campaign
  at short notice. Overall the MiTSO team delivered a creative and focused
  campaign against all the targets and was delivered on time and within budget.

# Social Media Advertising and PR

Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade approached us to promote business advice and support workshops to help get businesses Brexit Ready.

We spent time intially with the team to develop graphics and editorial for six local newspapers to commence a 4-week campaign to advertise the free workshops for local businesses. 

The main focus of the newspaper campaign was to increase awareness of the free workshops whilst discussing a different theme each week from industry leaders. 

Working alongside Newry Chamber, we focused on developing key messages which would be relevant to the unique challenges faced by border businesses. 

Social Ads were initatied to support the offline promotional activity. As the political environment was changing on a daily basis, the social media campaigns were reguarly adapted and optimised to focus on key workshops that were relevant.
