  The MiTSO team were truly professional in the delivery of a high profile
  campaign for Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade. The challenge was to deliver
  a 4 week campaign in support of the Chamberâ€™s Brexit advice campaign, across
  newspapers and social media. 


  In an ever changing political environment, they responded quickly and
  creatively to changes in the campaign requirements. Their strong understanding
  of social media allowed them to adapt and change the emphasis of the campaign
  at short notice. Overall the MiTSO team delivered a creative and focused
  campaign against all the targets and was delivered on time and within budget.

# Social Media Advertising and PR

Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade approached us to promote business advice and support workshops to help get businesses Brexit Ready.

We initially spent time with the team to develop graphics and editorial for six local newspapers to commence a 4-week campaign to advertise the workshops for local businesses. 

The main focus of the PR and social media advertisitng campaign was to increase awareness and to convert businesses to sign up for free workshops. The editorial was adapted on a weekly basis to highlight different themes which were relevant to business owners. 

Working alongside Newry Chamber, we focused on developing key messages which would be relevant to the unique challenges faced by border businesses. 

Our social campaign ran across four platforms and complimented offline activity and we developed graphic material and were responsible for setting up and monitoring the campaign for its duration. 

As the political environment was changing on a daily basis, we also reguarly adapted and optimised the campaign to shift the focus were necessary and help to encourage more signups.
