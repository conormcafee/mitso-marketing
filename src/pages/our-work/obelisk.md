testimonial: >-
  I was lucky enough to be given Mitso’s contact information when our company
  decided to undertake a complete rebranding exercise. From day 1 meeting Maeve
  I knew we had made the right choice. Not only is she fantastic at her job but
  she also naturally adapts to suit her environment and her audience. 

  She is extremely efficient, focused and patient! She listens to what you need
  whilst also giving you direction and ideas. She delivered on everything we
  needed and more and we could not have achieved what we did without her. We
  continue to use her company’s services. I would highly recommend her and her
  team, you will not be disappointed.

Obelisk is a multinational company delivering infrastructure solutions for the telecoms and power sectors in Ireland, UK and Africa. The company wanted to align its ambitions to grow with a brand refresh to present a new direction for the company.

# Branding, graphic design, website development and videography

We arranged initial workshops with the senior team at Obelisk to establish what was important to the company and what message they wanted to portray.

The team were happy with the existing logo but we recommended modernising it and delivering a number of brand materials to compliment the brand.

We spent time with the team agreeing website design and navigation - most importantly advising the team on how content should be arranged to reflect the organisational structure and ethos of the company.

At MiTSO, we strongly recommend investing in professional visuals prior to launching any digital channels. We co-ordinated a number of photography and videography sessions including drone filming, resulting in impressive imagery for online and offline use.

Working alongside Obelisk, we agreed on all of the material and brand assets required and delivered copywriting services, where needed.

We continue to work with Obelisk developing the brand and delivering campaigns which help to build its reputation.
