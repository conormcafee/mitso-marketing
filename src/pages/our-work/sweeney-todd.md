  I'm an absolute dinosaur when it comes to social media! However after meeting
  Maeve that has changed at the speed of light. Maeve has dragged me kicking and
  screaming into the 21st century but in the gentlest understanding way, Maeve
  is truly amazing and in a very short space of time has improved my business
  hugely. I couldn't recommend Maeve & her team at MiTSO enough. Thank you so
  much MiTSO!

We met with Sweeney Todd Barbers in Kilkenny for a consultation to assess where the business was and to understand the business objectives. It was clear that this was a thriving city centre business with a great reputation, but it had lost some of its sparkle and with little knowledge of how the world of digital really works, we wanted to take the girls on the journey with us and let them be part of the process rather than handing them a new brand and website and saying goodbye.

# Branding

First and foremost the business needed a refresh, a new look that would both encapsulate the brand and attract a younger audience. We presented the business with a number of concepts to choose from. They loved the inclusion of Sweeney Todd's iconic cut throat and the style of Option 2, so we further developed this option and ended up with a design that was clean, concise and most importantly congruent with the business.

From our initial meeting it was clear that Sweeney Todd's clients were at the heart of the business. When coming to the final stages of the brand design process, we decided to share the various colour options and asked customers to choose their favourite which resulted in positive consumer engagement and of course the black and amber came out on top! 

# Social Media 

We assessed Sweeney Todd’s existing social presence and it was clear that they needed to be more consistent in delivering engaging and fresh content. Facebook was the only social channel that the business was currently active on, but having reviewed the target audience as well as the nature of the business we agreed that setting up a new Instagram was also advisable. As we do with all of our clients, we advised the business to stick to a limited number of channels rather than not being properly active on loads of different channels. We set up a process for delivering more content, making photography part of the ladies daily routines and it worked!

We also recommended asking customers for reviews on Google and Facebook and particularly for regular customers, to leave them while they sat in the chair (otherwise they’d forget!). In addition, updating Google My Business with accurate and updated business information was vital and remembering to post on the channel was a must! 

# Website 

We knew that simplicity was key for the business' target audience and so we developed a one page website with all the necessary content as well as a clear call to action. At the end of the day, a man who wants a haircut makes the decision on the spot and simply seeks information on price, opening hours and contact information - nice imagery and branding is a bonus! The newly developed branding is at the heart of the site design from colour scheme to the subtle inclusion of the cut throat and with other simple design features, it makes for a simple but stunning site. 

The business has also now recruited a new member of staff and reports that they have “...never, ever been busier and the difference is remarkable. We’re seeing new faces all the time!”
