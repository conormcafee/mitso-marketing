Willow is a designer dress hire service based in Newry, Co. Down passionate about sustainable fashion and making designer brands accessible for everyone.

# **Brand development, website design and website development**

Willow approached us to create a brand which encapsulated the sustainable ethos and designer fashion element of the business

The client was keen to create a brand that incorporated the leaves of a willow tree but also communicated an air of elegance. The client provided us with the styles and inspiration she wished to emulate and from there we were able to design a range of concepts for her to choose from. Once a design was chosen we finalised the logo for use across social media and the new website.

The newly developed branding is at the heart of the website design from colour scheme to the subtle inclusion of the willow leaves. branding, green, nature

Willow is the first business of its kind in the Newry area so we wanted to communicate how the service works in a clear and concise manner throughout the site.

User experience and navigation were reviewed throughout the website's development to ensure the brands, dresses and sizes available were easy for users to browse. We developed a fully responsive website ensuring it was mobile optimised. The powerful visuals coupled with other simple design features make for a simple but stunning site.
