Willow is a designer dress hire service based in Newry, Co. Down passionate about sustainable fashion and making designer brands accessible for everyone.

# **Brand development, website design and website development**

Willow approached us to create a new brand and website which encapsulated the sustainable ethos and designer fashion element of the business.

The client was keen to create a brand that incorporated the leaves of a willow tree but also communicated an air of elegance. After providing us with the styles and inspiration she wished to emulate we were able to design a variety of concepts. Once a design was chosen we developed and finalised the logo for use across social media and the new website.

The newly developed branding is at the heart of the website design from colour scheme to the subtle inclusion of the willow leaves. We knew it was important to incorporate a colour scheme that resembled nature including soft greens and creams that tied in with the 'Willow' theme but also subtly represent the business' core values of sustainability. 

User experience and navigation were reviewed throughout the website's development to ensure the brands, dresses and sizes available were easy for users to browse. We developed a fully responsive website ensuring it was mobile optimised. Additional features include the 'Willow Weekly' blog to increase SEO as well as email marketing, a high ROI marketing channel that increases customer retention. 

Capturing impactful imagery is one of our top recommendations for website design, Willow invited us to assist with their photo shoot and once again we ensured that the designer dresses were captured against the backdrop of nature to tie in with the branding. 

The powerful visuals coupled with other simple design features make for a [simple but stunning site.](willownewry.com)
