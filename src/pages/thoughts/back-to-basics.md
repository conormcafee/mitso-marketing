Hospitality marketing is more than following the crowd, it is about thinking outside the box and looking for the next big thing.

Coming from a hospitality family background and working in the industry for many years, it is evident to see that most hotels have had to invest wisely in digital marketing to remain competitive. 

It is essential to focus on the basics such as good customer service and a clean establishment before you begin to promote your business online. When you can identify that the basics have been achieved, you can start to advertise the story behind the brand! 

Social media can have an immense impact on a business, particularly when customer service is involved. Consumers in the 21st century live and breathe social media, sharing pictures of food, hotels and attractions has become the ‘norm’ for people. Therefore, restaurants and hotels must utilise this to attract and engage consumers through posting stories and tagging the business in posts. 

Here are some top tips from MiTSO on how to optimise your social media platforms:

## **Optimise each social media profile**

Creating a standout profile on each channel will improve brand awareness and make it easier for people to know what you do. Be sure to specify your location, hours, the products or services you offer and any general information you think is relevant for your customer.

## **Be humorous and unique with your posts**

Consumers love nothing more than having a laugh on social media, providing quirky content ideas engages consumers and is sure to attract people to the business. 

## **Advertise** 

The recent change in the Facebook algorithm means it is much harder to achieve organic reach. We recommend setting aside a certain proportion of your budget to advertise  specific specific celebrations such as Mother’s Day via targeted campaigns. It requires minor investment however, it will have a positive long term impact by increasing revenue and attracting more followers. NB: Do not advertise on social media without setting SMART objectives first. 

## **Request customer reviews**

Convincing customers to review your products will help increase brand awareness and engagement. For example, ask customers directly to review your restaurant, be sure to make it easy for them to leave a review and offer incentives for writing them. Remember to acknowledge the review and say thank you!

## **Develop worthy photography and videography for social channels**

Facebook in particular guarantees higher engagement when high quality photos or videos are used, simple visual content attracts the eye and people are more likely to remember it than text. To ensure optimisation for the different platforms, make sure you are using the right image sizes for the various platforms. 

Remember, every post you put on social media is an illustration of your brand so make sure you make a good impression!
