  What a week...scared, confused, devastated, there are not enough words to
  describe some of the feelings us business owners have had. One of our clients
  described #covid19 as a “debt or death” situation and she was so right!
  Ultimately health is your wealth, but we can’t take away from some of the
  devastation this has caused to business owners.  We are extremely lucky (for
  now) that we can continue working but we also realise we are in a position
  where we can and should give solid advice to businesses who have literally had
  to close up shop. Here are some top tips for businesses to continue selling
  online...

\- No online store? No worries. You can still set up a Facebook Shop, upload images, product descriptions and prices allowing customers to click “Message to Buy” instead of transacting online. This way, customers can still see your full product range and select what they want to enquire about. Tip: do not add non-physical products like gift vouchers as Facebook will decline those items.

\- Own a restaurant or coffee shop? Look for ways to use existing digital technology to enable customers to order food to go. Simply ask people to send messages on social media or use existing apps like Goodies to allow them to place orders to pick up or get delivered, easily and quickly. Check out how local coffee shop Blend & Batch are doing it... https://bit.ly/2U4gKtb

\- Offer discounts to incentivise sales, but be mindful that you don’t necessarily need to do this all the time. Instead, encourage your customers to continue to shop locally with you and if they were planning on buying something anyway, encourage them to buy it from you and not some global chain.

\- Communicate more effectively...send emails to make sure customers still know you’re operating via your online shop or that you’ve introduced a new safe way to access products. Don’t let them think you’ve gone away!

\- Engage with your audience and offer advice and support where you can. From our perspective, times like these are NOT to be used to try and win business, it is about helping your local community where you can.

If any small business needs support or advice in any way, please don’t hesitate to send us a private message. We’re all in this together!
