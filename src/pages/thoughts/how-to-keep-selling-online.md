What a week...scared, confused, devastated, there are not enough words to describe the mood amongst business owners. One of our clients described #covid19 as a “debt or death” situation and she was so right because ultimately your health is your wealth, but we can’t take away from some of the devastation this outbreak has caused.  

We are extremely lucky (for now) that we can continue working but we also realise we are in a position where we can and should give solid advice to businesses who have literally had to close up shop.

So, here are some top tips for businesses to try to help you continue selling online...

# Facebook Shop

No online store? No worries. You can still set up a Facebook Shop, upload images, product descriptions and prices allowing customers to click “Message to Buy” instead of transacting online. This way, customers can actually see your full product range and select what they want to enquire about. Tip: do not add non-physical products like gift vouchers as Facebook will decline those items.

# Delivery

Look for ways to use existing digital technology to enable customers to order items for delivery. Simply ask people to send messages on social media or use existing apps like Goodies to allow them to place orders easily and quickly. 

# Online tutorials

Are you a service or skills based business? Why not try your hand at video tutorials for lessons you would normally charge a fee for. You don’t need fancy equipment, just record videos using your iPhone and publish sneak previews on Instagram’s IGTV for example. Then simply set up a YouTube channel, upload videos for free and publish them on ’private mode’, with full links available for a fee. You can also host group classes via the Zoom app (use the free version for group calls lasting 40mins, anyhing longer we recomend upgrading to Pro for c.£12 per month for unlimited time calls).

# Discounts

Offer discounts to incentivise sales, but be mindful that you don’t necessarily need to do this all the time. Instead, continue to encourage your customers to shop locally with you and not bigger chains. 

# Communication

Communicate more effectively...send emails to make sure customers still know you’re operating via your online shop or that you’ve introduced a new and safe way to access products. Don’t let them think you’ve gone away!

# Offer advice

Engage with your audience online and offer advice and support where you can. From our perspective, times like these are NOT to be used to try and win business, it is about helping your local community where you can so let’s all work together to support each other and weather this storm!
