Happy 2021 everyone, I hope January went smoothly for you all considering all of the personal and business challenges we face. January is definitely one of the most testing months of the year at the best of time, so I am glad we are through it.

January Blues, anticipation for what may or may not be, coupled with the fact that it can be a busy time for planning the year ahead, makes it a pretty stressful time. 

However, strangely it is my favourite time of year in business. Mostly because I love planning but also because it gives us a chance to refocus on our own business and to set goals for the year.

Over the years, I’ve learned first hand how hard it is to remain focused on your own business goals, particularly when you’re so busy fulfilling client needs. For this reason, I promised myself that we would be much more disciplined with our time in 2021 - you have to make the time and more and more, we are trying to work smarter.

Instead of putting it off, we have been making small incremental changes to how we work over the past few weeks and have been working hard behind the scenes to really refine our internal processes.

We have invested in new software, completed a brand refresh of internal client documentation, assessed our tender processes, kickstarted our own website refresh, planned our own training for the year, engaged with Invest NI regarding support for our growth plans and most excitingly we have started to look for new people! It is amazing what you can achieve when you simply make the time.

2020 was by far our best year yet and I say that knowing how extremely fortunate we are. It was also the year I welcomed our second little bundle of joy and renovated our house so I am completely indebted to [Ciara](https://www.mitsomarketing.com/thoughts/promotion-for-our-very-own-digital-superwoman/), who single handed ran the business in my absence. I am also so grateful for the wonderful network of freelance designers and digital marketing gurus. Without you we would be nowhere - thank you all, you know who you are!

2021 is shaping up to be another super busy one for us here at MiTSO and now is the time to grow our own internal team. Our client base is growing in Bermuda, we‘re just about to implement our client media plan to launch [Ireland’s first Alpine Coaster](https://www.colinglen.org/product/colin-glen-coaster/) and we’re continuing to work with lots of new clients through our consultancy work for [InterTrade Ireland's Emerge programme](https://intertradeireland.com/covid-19-supports/e-merge) (if you haven't yet applied, definetly do!). 

We will continue to be mindful of the many businesses who aren't so fortunate and we encourage any small local businesses to get in touch with any questions or just for advice or a chat. Our doors are always open!

We hope 2021 is the year where we start to see the end of this nightmare and we continue to see businesses diversifying and embracing change. We certainly have lots to be thankful for and we're determined to make the most of the opportunities presented to us.

Maeve
