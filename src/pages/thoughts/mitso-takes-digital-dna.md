The two-day conference boasted an incredible line up of speakers from some of the biggest companies in the world including McDonald’s, Google, PwC, Aflac and Belfast’s newest residents, ASOS. From Google search trends to digital transformation, NFTs to innovative UX design, there was so much to learn. 

Here’s some of MiTSO’s key takeaways from the event... 

**Charlotte: Human touch is still a huge part of digital brand interaction** 

This was something I learned from a few of the speakers, notably McDonald’s UK’s Director of Digital, Karl Boyce. 

As he spoke on the digital transformation that McDonald’s has undergone in the past two years, Karl highlighted that 60% of McDonald’s business is derived from their self-service kiosks, mobile orders and delivery services. That being said, he assured that there will always be a need for “feel good” customer experiences that are tactile, sensory and sociable, which the bricks and mortar restaurants playing a big part in that. 

In a post-COVID world, brands must be careful to avoid creating purely transactional digital experiences, but instead focus on specific and adaptable tactics that acknowledge their varied audiences. Customer satisfaction is much more than efficiency alone. 

**Ciara: Look out for the little guy** 

Listening to Google’s Ryan Owens, Director of Google Shopping, he highlighted that competition online has increased, and the big brands aren’t always coming out on top! 

Google has noticed big brands are starting to lose out to smaller, lesser-known brands. This is particularly true for fashion, where customers are not as interested in big brands and fast fashion but are now looking for sustainable and ethical brands. People want more choice than ever and they want it now! This means offering free and fast shipping, flexibility and good returns policies – these are fundamental for the future success of any e-commerce brand. 

**Maeve: Don't just talk the talk** 

I was able to sit in on lots of great speaker and panel sessions, but the one that stood out the most was FATHOM’s Gareth Dunlop discussing the next 10,000 Days of Web Design. FATHOM is a company we’ve always admired here at MITSO and it was great to hear Gareth’s take on Web 4.0 and the shift toward advanced meaning. The future of web opens up a whole new opportunity for brands to communicate with users in the same way that we communicate with each other in real life and as the digital world becomes reimagined, so do our own lives – how we work and live. Take a look at Facebook’s Horizon Workrooms as an example of what’s to come! 

On the theme of adapting, it was very insightful to hear from John Hogg from Enlighten IC as he discussed how his business completely changed direction during the pandemic to become a start up all over again. I’d be a rich woman if I had a pound for every time someone used the word “pivot” in the past two years, but this was a really impressive example of successfully reshaping your business model, while keeping both the business and jobs in tact. 

Overall, the key takeaway for me was, if you truly know your stuff and have the experience to back it up, you don’t need to overpromote and shout about what you do. The most interesting speakers and panels at this year’s conference were not the ones who simply spent the time promoting their own businesses, but those who offered the audience something truly valuable – whether that’s genuine advice, case studies or new data and trend insights. This is something that we always reiterate to our clients, particularly in the digital space: it can be tempting to try to shout the loudest, but a solid product or service offering, and consistent, high quality customer experience will speak for itself and take you much further!
