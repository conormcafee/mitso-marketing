In March of this year, I joined the marvellous MiTSO team as Brand Communications Manager. 

Since then, there’ve been content calendars galore, mountainside video shoots and a few too many goes on Ireland’s first alpine coaster... 

In my first six months, here’s six things I’ve learned along the way: 

1. **There’s much more to it than you think** 

MiTSO Marketing is branding, strategy, campaign management, digital advertising, email marketing, asset creation, content creation, PR, website development, SEO, social media... this is not an exhaustive list! Every day brings a new challenge and opportunity to think outside the box for clients, and it’s a really exciting agency team to be a part of. 

2. **Digital is the way forward** 

Coming from a more PR-focused background, I didn’t have much previous hands-on experience with digital marketing. Since starting with MiTSO, I’ve quickly learned how important digital strategy is to businesses big and small (especially during a global pandemic!) and how even the smallest of digital tactics can have a huge impact. With digital ads on target to account for 50% of global ad spend in 2021, it’s allowing businesses to remain agile and highly responsive in their marketing through even the most unpredictable circumstances. 

3. **Step away from the Boost button!** 

Working alongside MiTSO’s Digital Marketing Manager, Ciara on social strategies for clients like Colin Glen, Cuilcagh Boardwalk and Giganet, I’ve learned that there’s much more to securing reach and engagement for your social content than simply boosting the post. In fact, this really isn’t effective at all! It’s a myriad of great visuals, snappy captions, audience-led insight and carefully planned ads to help you get the best return on investment - trust the digital managers on this one! 

4. **The power of words** 

My role is heavily based around copywriting and content creation – press releases, social content, website copy, brochure and poster copy, media partnerships, brand messaging, the list goes on! The skills I’ve built up from my PR experience have been extremely beneficial when it comes to crafting brand comms for MiTSO’s clients. The words you use for your brand or business shouldn’t be an afterthought; they’re your voice and personality, and they’re a huge part of any marketing campaign. Use them wisely! 

5. **An army of specialists makes a dream team** 

In an agency that manages various parts of the marketing mix for clients, having dedicated specialists means you can deliver the best quality integrated marketing campaigns every time! Maeve is a laser-focused, media-planning magician who keeps campaigns running smoothly, and Ciara is an incredibly talented Digital Marketer who knows algorithms and analytics like the back of her hand. We're also incredibly lucky to have a network of highly skilled professionals to help us operate as a full service agency. Joining the team as the resident content creator, it’s amazing to see it all come together for client campaigns and see everyone’s individual strengths in true collaboration. 

6. **O’Hare’s German biscuits are the best German biscuits. FACT.** 

Believe me, it’s been taste-tested. Shout out to Mulkern’s Eurospar for keeping us stocked up! (And yes this is probably thee most important thing I’ve learned.) 

Here’s to the next six months!
