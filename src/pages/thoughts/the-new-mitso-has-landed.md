The day has finally arrived - the new MiTSO has just landed. Complete with a new brand identity, website and digital makeover, the company has officially relaunched.

The new bolder, brighter look, a nod to our fresh approach and confidence, has been a long time in the making. We’ve been beavering away for months, sketching, strategising and simplifying our company mission.

In that time, we have also worked on some amazing global projects and worked with some world class brands, expanded our team and we’ll be moving into a shiny new office very soon. 

Established back in 2016, the company started from small beginnings - with an iPad, single desk and a mission to succeed. Uncertain where the road would take us, we decided to take things slowly and grow the company in the right way.

We secured a number of contracts both north and south of Ireland and in the UK. We built a reputable brand and recruited the right team of digital marketing experts to facilitate projects across a range of industries including esports, technology, retail, entertainment and construction. 

Managing Director, Maeve Finnegan said: “Like any new startup, it’s a daunting experience to try and build something from scratch. At the beginning, even my close family and friends were sceptical.

Fast forward three years and we have built something I’m truly proud of. It is the perfect time for us to be relaunching the brand as we now have a great team of passionate marketing professionals and we know exactly who we are and where we’re going.

We’ll continue to focus on domestic growth and will also work to secure more global contracts and high profile campaigns. We’re a local company with global potential and now, we’re not shy about it.”
