The new bolder, brighter look, a nod to our fresh approach and confidence, has been a long time in the making. We’ve been beavering away for months, sketching, strategising and simplifying our company mission.

In that time, we have also worked on some amazing global projects, expanded our team and we’ll be moving into a shiny new office very soon. 

Established back in 2016, the company started from small beginnings - with an iPad, single desk and a mission to succeed. Uncertain where the road would take us, we decided to take things slowly and grow the company in the right way.

We built a reputable brand and the right team before finalising our business plans and putting in place a brand identity which we hope will last a lifetime.

Managing Director, Maeve Finnegan said: “Like any new startup, it’s a daunting experience to try and build something from scratch. At the beginning, even my close family and friends were sceptical.

Fast forward three years and we have built something I’m truly proud of. It is the perfect time for us to be relaunching the brand as we now have a great team of passionate marketing professionals and we know exactly who we are and where we’re going.”
