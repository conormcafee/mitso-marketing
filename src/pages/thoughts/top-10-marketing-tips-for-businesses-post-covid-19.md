1. There has never been a better time to make any changes to your business such as refreshing your brand/image or changing the way you operate. What does your product or service look like in the 'new normal'? Has your offering changed? Does your brand still effectively communicate what you do?
2. Look to improve efficiency within your business and making it easier for customers to transact. You could introduce online booking, contactless payment, handling customer enquiries via WhatsApp etc.
3. How is your business going to handle appointments? As a lot of businesses move towards bookings only, we recommend utilising tools such as your website, Google My Business or social media. 
4. Now more than ever, it is important to have a Google My Business profile that is up to date with the latest information including opening hours, telephone numbers and how your business is currently operating. If you don't have a Google My Business profile, [click here](https://support.google.com/business/answer/6300717?hl=en-GB) to find out how to set yours up.
5. You may need to adjust your pricing due to additional equipment or measures you need to implement. Be sure to communicate this to your customers and explain why you have had to make any such adjustments.
6. Be authentic on your social media channels. It is important to build trust with your audience and show the face behind your brand at this time. Maybe it's time to show your lovely face on screen and start speaking on camera? 
7. Improve your online reviews strategy. Depending on your type of business this is a good time to refine your review strategy whether it is social media or Google reviews. Remember to draft a thoughtful template response to manage online reviews going forward. 
8. Communicate properly. With changes to the current situation being made everyday, it is vital that you continue to communicate with customers. Keep customers informed and give them accurate information about any changes to your business.
9. Don't fall back into old habits. Many businesses took the time during lock down to review their marketing strategies, digital presence and plan for the future. Don't forget about setting aside time for marketing once you start to get busy again, it's more important than ever to plan ahead.
10. Survey your customers and use their feedback. This is new to everyone, ask customers about their experience either in person and/or through an email survey. Use negative feedback to adjust and improve your customer experience. Share positive feedback (with permission) as social proof that your new customer experience is enjoyable and safe.
