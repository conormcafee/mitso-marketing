**Brand Communications Manager** 

MiTSO is seeking a talented Brand Communications Manager to create and implement communication strategies for our clients. We are looking for someone who is passionate about enhancing our clients brand identity and possesses the creative skills required to develop and execute content strategies, to fulfil our client's needs. You will act as a brand spokesperson on behalf of our clients and develop strong relationships with the media, whilst ensuring that our client's reputation and bottom line grow beyond their expectations.  

**Who We Are** 

MiTSO is a full-service marketing agency based in Newry. Our work spans across three main areas; brand, digital and PR. We serve clients locally across Ireland and the UK and as far as Bermuda and we have worked with a number of major global brands. It is an exciting time for our company as we look forward to expanding our service offering and furthering growth, both domestically and globally.  

We are perfectionists at heart – we work extremely hard, and we are passionate about delivering results for our clients. We love to be creative, and most importantly, we operate in a fun, welcoming environment where no idea is ever too silly. 

**Who You Are** 

You are a confident and hardworking individual who thrives in a busy environment. You have the ability to work across a range of client accounts and build strong relationships with all of our clients, media and wider stakeholders. You have experience in developing brand communications strategies and executing tactical media plans. You are highly creative and would be comfortable describing yourself as a “copywriting king/queen”. You love to get to know clients and deliver excellence for them, even if that means being flexible with your approach and time.   

**What You Will Do** 

The successful candidate will hit the ground running and work with our new and existing clients to develop media plans for 2021 and work to begin implementing those plans. You will work closely with our Digital Marketing Manager to assist with developing content strategies, generate engaging and creative copy for our client digital and PR campaigns, and help manage those campaigns daily. You will execute media plans for our clients throughout the annual calendar and work closely with the media across Ireland to ensure optimal coverage for our clients. You will be the ears and eyes for our clients, working proactively to identify and capture any opportunities.  

**Requirements** 

* Minimum 4 years of experience in a similar role 
* Excellent copywriting skills; from ad copy to media releases 
* Experience in creating SEO optimised content 
* Hold existing relationships with media across Ireland 
* Ability to develop creative content for client campaigns (experience in using graphic design and video editing tools a plus!) 
* Experience in developing and executing media plans for a range of clients  
* Experience in assisting digital teams with content and campaigns 
* Passion for great content and copy! 

_Note:_ We regularly visit clients on site and therefore the successful candidate will need a full, clean driving license and have access to a car. 

**What We Offer** 

We make every effort to ensure that MiTSO is always a fun place to work. We work hard, but we believe that working in an open, creative and enjoyable office environment helps us collectively to deliver for our clients. You will receive on-the-job training and we offer additional training where necessary to ensure our team are continually upskilling. We offer flexibility in our working week, as long as the job is done. Salary is negotiable for the role and will be based on previous experience. 

**\*\*COVID 19\*\*** 

Due to the current COVID 19 pandemic, we are currently working from home, and it is expected that the role will initially require remote working until such times that we can return to the office.  

**Apply Now** 

To apply for the role, please forward a copy of your CV or share your LinkedIn profile with Maeve Finnegan (<mailto:maeve@mitsomarketing.com>). Closing date is **Monday 1st February at 5pm**.
