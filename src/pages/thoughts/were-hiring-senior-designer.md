**Who We Are** 

MiTSO is a brand and digital agency based in Newry. Our work spans across three main areas; brand, digital and PR. We serve clients locally across Ireland, UK and as far as Bermuda, having worked with a number of major global brands. It is an exciting time for our company as we look forward to expanding our service offering and furthering growth, both domestically and globally.  

We are perfectionists at heart, working extremely hard to deliver great results for our clients. We are creative, and most importantly, we operate in a fun, open environment where no idea is ever too far outside-the-box. 

**Who You Are** 

You are a highly creative, confident and hardworking individual who thrives in a busy environment. You have the ability to work across a range of client accounts, getting to the heart of client and customer needs so that you can deliver unique and highly relevant brands and assets. You have experience in developing brand identities and developing full suites of content for both online and offline projects. You understand what it means to be small enough to care, but to always dream big and to continue to push boundaries for our clients, no matter their size. You have a passion for all things media and like to try new things, always. 

**What You Will Do** 

The successful candidate will be responsible for working with clients end to end, to develop unique and effective brand identities and to create visuals which leave a lasting impact. You will work closely with our Digital Marketing Manager and Brand Communications Manager to deliver end-to-end brand and digital identities and campaigns, acting as our lead in developing brand strategies for our clients both at home and abroad.  

**Requirements** 

* Minimum 5 years of experience in a similar role 
* Skilled across the full Adobe Suite  
* Experience in assisting digital teams with development of digital content (website and social) 
* Experience in brand identity development and full implementation across all asset types 
* Strong knowledge of digital design and social, and ability to create (or assist with) video content for key platforms including Instagram and TikTok  
* Proven ability to manage projects end to end, on time and within budget 
* Passion for great content and copy 
* Ability to develop motion graphics or animation is a plus 

_Note: We regularly visit clients on site and therefore the successful candidate will need a full, clean driving license and have access to a car._ 

**What We Offer** 

We make every effort to ensure that MiTSO is always a fun place to work. We work hard, but we believe that working in an open, creative and enjoyable office environment helps us collectively to deliver for our clients. You will receive on-the-job training and we offer additional training where necessary to ensure our team is continuously upskilling. We offer flexibility in our working week and hybrid working (a mix of remote and office working), as long as the job is done. Salary is negotiable for the role and will be based on previous experience. 

**\*\*COVID 19\*\*** 

Due to the current COVID 19 pandemic, we are offering both in-person or virtual interviews, and the role will offer hybrid working (working from home and the office at least once bi-weekly). 

**Apply Now**  

To apply for the role, please forward a copy of your CV or share your LinkedIn profile along with a copy of your portfolio to Maeve Finnegan (maeve@mitsomarketing.com). Closing date is Monday 3rd January at 5pm.
