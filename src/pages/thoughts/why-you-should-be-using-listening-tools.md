Are your ears burning? They should be! If you have an online presence then there are three simple reasons as to why you should be undertaking social listening.

## 1.	Understand brand position

Social listening is used to analyse online conversations by tracking keywords, topics and phrases. This can be everything from brand mentions (with or without direct tagging) and relevant hashtags to your competitor’s product names. This helps brands gain key insights into what people are saying about their business, competitors and the industry as a whole.

Social listening helps brands gain an understanding of who their customers really are and their perceptions of the brand. Once brands have an understanding of this they can can then assess potential opportunities and threats.

## 2.	Identify opportunities

The ability to identify opportunities is one of the main benefits of social listening; listening to what people are saying can inspire ideas for everything from content to product modification. 

A great example is when Thea Chippendale from Lincoln, posted a tweet showing a screenshot of  messages from a Tinder match saying her dress didn’t do her “any favours” and looked like a “charity shop job”.

Her tweet went viral, and with more than 98,000 likes and 7,000 retweets it was soon discovered the dress was from major online fashion retailer, [ASOS.](https://www.asos.com/women/)

ASOS capitalised on the online buzz and got in touch with Thea asking if they could use her image for their product page. The result? Thousands of tweets praising the brand, an increase in web traffic and positive media coverage.

## 3.	Spot Potential Risks

We all know that comments online aren’t always positive and it only takes one poorly constructed response for a major brand to face backlash. Listening tools can help track any negative comments and assess any potential risks to brand reputation. 

Whether or not you watch Game of Thrones we all heard about THAT coffee cup. Fans of the show were quick to point out the major blunder in the hit TV show’s final season and screenshots of the scene and memes poking fun at the mistake were quick to go viral.

Rather than releasing a serious statement, [HBO](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/hbo-coffee-cup-game-of-thrones-1203206397/) decided to make a light-hearted joke about the mistake reflective of the online conversation:

> “The latte that appeared in the episode was a mistake. Daenerys had ordered an herbal tea,”

The statement received a positive response online as the producers simply accepted they had made a mistake and HBO later edited the scene to remove the coffee cup. 

## Tools for social listening:
